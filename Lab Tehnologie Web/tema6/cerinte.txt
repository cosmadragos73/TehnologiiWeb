Create 2 small servlets and 2 HTML pages with the following functionality:

    the first HTML page will contain a form having the following fields:
        user first name (text)
        user last name (text)
        user username (text)
        user password (password - at least 6 characters with validation)
        user retyped password (password)
        user address (text)
        user email (text â€“ with js validation)
        user interests (textarea)
        clear form button and a submit button
        Only the first part of the Homework is mandatory. The second part will be added to the end of the JSP laboratory from next week.
    the second HTML page will contain a form for querying a database for users as follows:
        a search textbox where the searched user (complete or partial) will be entered
        2 radio buttons (one called Exact search and the other Containing) for search options.
        a submit button
    the first servlet will store the user information from the first HTML page both inside a session and inside a database. The database structure will be designed so that it can hold the submitted information.
    the second servlet will return the result of the query performed by the second HTML page.
