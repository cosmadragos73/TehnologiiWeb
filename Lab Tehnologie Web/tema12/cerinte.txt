    Create a simple JSP page which queries a Weather Service (You can find details on the methods and arguments for an already published .NET WS at: http://www.webservicex.net/ws/WSDetails.aspx?CATID=12&WSID=56) and displays an image depending on the current weather data (you can display images similar to those used by the Windows Vista/7). The page should be HTML 4.01 Strict valid
